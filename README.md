# Obsidian_Date Highlighter

This plugin visually highlights dates in your Obsidian notes and filenames using a color-coded system to indicate how recent or old the dates are. Here are its main features:

1. **Date Detection:**
   - Recognizes multiple date formats:
     - YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2024-03-30)
     - MM/DD/YYYY (e.g., 03/30/2024)
     - DD-MM-YYYY (e.g., 30-03-2024)
     - YYYY.MM.DD (e.g., 2024.03.30)

2. **Color-Coding System:**
   - Recent dates (default: within 14 days) are highlighted in green
   - Intermediate dates (default: 15-30 days) are highlighted in yellow
   - Older dates are highlighted in red

3. **Dual Highlighting:**
   - Highlights dates within note content (inline highlighting)
   - Highlights note titles/filenames that contain dates
   
4. **Interactive Features:**
   - Hovering over highlighted dates shows a tooltip with relative time (e.g., "2 days ago", "Yesterday", "In 3 days")

5. **Customization Options:**
   - Toggle inline content highlighting
   - Toggle filename highlighting
   - Customize time periods for recent and intermediate dates
   - Customize colors for each time category (recent, intermediate, old)
   - Customize text color for highlighted dates

This plugin helps users quickly visualize and track date-related information in their notes, making it easier to identify recent and older content at a glance.
